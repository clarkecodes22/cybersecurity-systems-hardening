## 🧩 Projects

### 1. [Performing a Vulnerability Assessment](./vulnerability-assessment)
Pinpointed security gaps using scanning tools to evaluate real-world risk—laid the foundation for proactive threat prevention.

### 2. [Performing Packet Capture and Traffic Analysis](./packet-capture-traffic-analysis)
Captured and dissected live network traffic to detect anomalies, identify protocols, and analyze packet behavior using Wireshark and tcpdump.

### 3. [Applying User Authentication and Access Controls](./user-authentication-access-controls)
Configured user roles, password policies, and access restrictions to secure authentication systems and enforce least privilege.

### 4. [Implementing an IT Security Policy](./implementing-IT-security-policy)
Drafted and deployed a formal security policy outlining rules, responsibilities, and acceptable use to reduce organizational risk.

### 5. [Implementing Security Monitoring and Logging](./implementing-security-monitoring-logging)
Deployed monitoring tools and set up event logging to track system activity, detect anomalies, and support incident response.

### 6. [Configuring Backup & Recovery Functions](./configuring-backup-recovery-functions)
Established reliable backup schedules, verified data restoration, and documented recovery procedures to ensure business continuity.
